Well hello stranger, welcome to my Wordle project. I promise it's not nearly as efficient or effective as the one 3Blue1Brown but you'll never miss a word, I think. 

The way it works is pretty simple. Copy the code into your own IDE and run it. Upon running, enter your preferred starting wordle word into wordle. Then copy it's accuracy into the command line in this format.

Format:
\_,\_,\_,\_,\_

\_ = any character

prepend yellow letters with "!"

prepend green letters with "^"

For example, if I entered aloes and got back yellow, grey, grey, green, yellow I would enter:

"!a,l,o,^e,!s" into the terminal.

Justin if you're reading this you forgot to:
- Make a GUI/ turn this into a web app
- Restructure the project since you know how to do it better now.
- Solve the daily wordle, I mean why else would you code this?
